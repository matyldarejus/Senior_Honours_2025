# Senior Honours 2025
All the code I needed to carry out my senior honours project 'Finding the Missing Baryons with NASA's Next Generation Telescope' supervised by Prof Romeel Dave at the University of Edinburgh. 

Environment in which the code was tested out to run best: 

'sh_env'
python=3.9 yt=4.2.1 matplotlib=3.4.3 numpy=1.22 scipy=1.9


## Acknowledgements

This repository is based on code originally developed by Sarah Appleby as part of her PhD project under the supervision of Romeel Dave at The University of Edinburgh.  

The original version can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahappleby/cgm/tree/master/absorption/ml_project).  

This fork has been adapted by me for use in my Senior Honours project. I'm trying to keep track of changes I make as I go along via commit messages :) The biggest difference is an updated Voigt profile fitter.

## Notes

I separated out the code meant to be ran with Simba and Simba-c - however, the only difference are the simulation data file paths :)
